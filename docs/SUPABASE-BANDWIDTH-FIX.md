# üö® Supabase Bandwidth Exceeded - Solutions

## Problem
You've exceeded the free 5GB cached egress limit by 0.19 GB.

**What this means:**
- Every time someone visits your site, data is downloaded from Supabase
- Images, API calls, and storage downloads count toward this limit
- At current rate: ~5.2 GB per month

## üí∞ Cost Impact
- **Overage cost:** ~$0.09/GB = **$0.02 for 0.19GB** (very small)
- But if trend continues, could be ~$0.50-2/month

## üîç What's Consuming Bandwidth?

Most likely causes (in order):

1. **Product images from Supabase Storage** (if using)
2. **Fetching product data on every page load**
3. **User profile/session checks**
4. **Admin dashboard queries**

## ‚úÖ Solutions (Choose One or More)

### Solution 1: Move Images to Cloudinary (RECOMMENDED)

**Why:** Cloudinary has 25GB free/month vs Supabase's 5GB

**Steps:**
1. You already have images in WooCommerce
2. Use WooCommerce image URLs directly (no Supabase storage needed)
3. Or upload to Cloudinary for faster loading

**Implementation:**
- Check if you're using Supabase Storage for images
- If yes, switch to WooCommerce URLs or Cloudinary
- If no, skip this

### Solution 2: Implement Aggressive Caching

**Add caching to reduce API calls:**

**For Product Data:**
```javascript
// Cache products for 1 hour instead of fetching every time
const CACHE_DURATION = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour

async function getCachedProducts() {
    const cached = localStorage.getItem('products_cache');
    const cacheTime = localStorage.getItem('products_cache_time');

    if (cached && cacheTime) {
        const age = Date.now() - parseInt(cacheTime);
        if (age < CACHE_DURATION) {
            console.log('Using cached products');
            return JSON.parse(cached);
        }
    }

    // Fetch fresh data
    console.log('Fetching fresh products');
    const { data } = await supabase.from('products').select('*');

    // Cache it
    localStorage.setItem('products_cache', JSON.stringify(data));
    localStorage.setItem('products_cache_time', Date.now().toString());

    return data;
}
```

**For Images:**
```javascript
// Add cache headers to Supabase Storage requests
const { data } = await supabase
    .storage
    .from('products')
    .download('image.jpg', {
        cacheControl: '3600' // Cache for 1 hour
    });
```

---

### Solution 3: Optimize What You Fetch

**Only fetch what you need:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad - fetches everything
const { data } = await supabase.from('products').select('*');

// ‚úÖ Good - only fetch needed fields
const { data } = await supabase
    .from('products')
    .select('id, name, price, image_url, slug')
    .limit(20); // Limit results
```

---

### Solution 4: Use CDN for Static Assets

**Setup Cloudflare (Free CDN):**

1. Sign up at https://cloudflare.com
2. Add your domain `estudioartesana.com`
3. Update nameservers (they'll guide you)
4. Enable caching rules for images

**Result:** Images and static files served from Cloudflare (unlimited free bandwidth)

---

### Solution 5: Reduce Admin Dashboard Queries

**Check admin dashboard usage:**
- Admin dashboard might be auto-refreshing data
- Reduce refresh frequency
- Only load data when sections are opened (already fixed for mayoristas!)

---

### Solution 6: Monitor and Identify the Culprit

**Check Supabase Logs:**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí API Logs
2. Look for:
   - Most frequent queries
   - Largest responses
   - Which tables are queried most

**Common findings:**
```
// If you see these a lot, they're the culprits:
- storage.from('products').download() ‚Üí Images from storage
- .from('products').select('*') ‚Üí Product data
- .from('user_profiles').select('*') ‚Üí User data
```

## üìä Quick Check: Are You Using Supabase Storage?

Run this to check if you're serving images from Supabase:

```bash
# Search for Supabase storage usage in your code
grep -r "supabase.storage" . --include="*.js" --include="*.html"
```

**If found:**
- Those images are consuming bandwidth
- Move to Cloudinary or WooCommerce URLs

**If not found:**
- Bandwidth is from API calls (product data, user profiles)
- Implement caching (Solution 2)

## üéØ Recommended Action Plan

**Priority order:**

### Week 1 (Immediate):
1. ‚úÖ Check Supabase Logs to identify the biggest consumer
2. ‚úÖ Implement product caching (Solution 2) - **Easiest, biggest impact**
3. ‚úÖ Optimize queries to only fetch needed fields (Solution 3)

### Week 2 (If still over limit):
4. ‚úÖ Move images to Cloudinary or use WooCommerce URLs
5. ‚úÖ Setup Cloudflare CDN for your domain

### Week 3 (Long-term):
6. ‚úÖ Monitor usage weekly
7. ‚úÖ Optimize based on logs

## üí° Expected Savings

| Action | Bandwidth Saved | Difficulty |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Product caching (1 hour) | ~60-70% | Easy ‚≠ê |
| Move images to Cloudinary | ~40-50% | Medium |
| Optimize queries | ~20-30% | Easy ‚≠ê |
| Cloudflare CDN | ~30-40% | Medium |
| All combined | ~80-90% | - |

**After implementing caching:**
- Expected usage: ~1-2 GB/month (well under 5GB limit)
- **Stay in free tier ‚úÖ**

## üöÄ Quick Win: Implement Product Caching

**File to update:** Where you fetch products (likely in WooCommerce API calls)

I can help you add caching to your product fetching code. Want me to find and update it?

---

## üìû Alternative: Upgrade Supabase

If you don't want to optimize:

**Supabase Pro:** $25/month
- Includes 250 GB bandwidth
- 100 GB database
- Daily backups
- Email support

**Worth it?** Only if you're making $100+/month and don't have time to optimize.

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Check logs** to confirm what's using bandwidth
2. **Implement caching** (I can help with this)
3. **Monitor** for a week
4. **Optimize further** if needed

- [ ] Find and add caching to your product fetching code?
- [ ] Check if you're using Supabase Storage for images?
- [ ] Set up Cloudinary for images?
- [ ] Help you analyze Supabase logs?
